# Majora's Mask: Recompiled Ocarina of Time Link Mod

This is a mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled that lets you change Link to be his Ocarina of Time counterpart.

You can choose to be either child or adult Link from OoT, or switch back to the orginal MM Link if desired.
<br/>**(You need to reload the current scene for this to take effect.)**

There is also an option named `Fix Color`, only disable this if you are using another mod which alters tunic colors.

There may be many problems with this mod, so be sure to leave any you encounter in the [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/ThatHypedPerson/MMRecompOoTLink/issues).

Thanks to LittleCube for testing the mod and adding the Vanilla option, along with everyone else in the N64 Recomp Modding Discord.
